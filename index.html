<h1><b>Keli Haines and Music</b></h1>

<h2><time datetime="2021-03-02">March 02, 2021</time></h2>
<h3> My name is Keli Haines. A few things about me...</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I am 28 years old and grew up in a small town in Nebraska across the street from a cornfield. At 20, I left home and joined the Air Force and spent 7 years across Active Duty and a full time position in the Wyoming Air National Guard. During that time, I traveled, grew up a lot, and got to see and experience a lot of new things. I thank my Air Force career for allowing me to meet my fianc√©, providing me with the knowledge to pursue a lucrative civilian career, and the VA benefits that now allow me to pursue an education, and purchase a home.</li>
	<br>
	<li>As far as the fun stuff, I am a big fan of video games, movies, and music. I like fitness, good weather, walks and jogs with my dog, and being around friends and family. I built a gaming computer recently (after a long hunt for a 3070 graphics card) and have always been a fan of story driven games. I've played drums to rock, metal, and blues for nearly 20 years - and even used to play in a band and travel to play concerts in small towns. I also am (slowly) learning guitar and piano. I love the outdoors, and have always been a big fan of hiking and water sports - in fact, there's been a constant struggle about whether to live near mountains or near the ocean. I've lost my interest in motorcycles after a painful accident in 2015, but every so often a Harley passing by peaks my interest. I also enjoy reading, woodworking, gardening, and the occasional road trip.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some websites that I really enjoy browsing on a daily basis.</p>
<ol>
	<li>I am a big fan of <a href="https://www.reddit.com"> Reddit</a> and find myself spending a lot of time reading here. I find that I can easily reach all of my interests, and find humorous or interesting content and news as well.</li>
	<li>I also find a lot of very important guides and time wasters when browsing<a href="https://www.youtube.com"> Youtube</a>. The amount of knowledge and resources there are simply amazing.</li>
	<li>Finally, I like to read through some highlights on <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com"> Gizmodo</a>. The links at the top let me quickly browse through multiple news in hobby areas such as tech, cars, video games, and media.</li>
