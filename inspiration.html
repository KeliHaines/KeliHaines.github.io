<h3>Who Wouldn't Want An Audience?</h3>
<p>Music has been such an integral part of human society for such a long time, that the importance can sometimes be forgotten. There are so many styles of music, and with so many messages behind it, that it can be intimidating to get started. There's definitely a reason why so many people would converge in a stadium to see their favorite musicians, though. There's something that can be lost by listening to a recording, instead of hearing a song live. The audience, the reverberence, the imperfections, the atmosphere and theme all play a key part in the impact of the songs. Musicians are entertainers, and storytellers, they are teachers and they are motivators. People all around the world listen and dream and are inspired by the songs that they play. So many people want to be that person, on the stage, being cheered on. If that's something that you've dreamed of, then there is no better time to start then now!</p>

<p>I can think of no better <b><u><a href="https://youtu.be/e05H80-k0mY">video </b></u></a> than this to motivate someone with music. Dave Grohl is a wonderful musician, who has given a lot of time and effort back into the music community, and constantly inspires the next generation to start their passion. This video demonstrates his passion to learn, and perform seamlessly, a 23-minute solo instrumental across 7 different instruments! </p>

<h2>The main thing to possess and harness, is the passion for music. Love of music, regardless of what it sounds like, is what will carry someone through the hours of practice. Pick something that you love and pursue it!</h2>
