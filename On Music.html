<h1>Why Music...?</h1>
<br>
<p>Music has always been something that I can turn to. It's been a bonding agent between myself, friends, and family. I've associated so many feelings and memories to songs that have been almost like an anthem to my life. I am a big reader, however I feel there is a different type of story that can be shared through music. And though there are many different reasons, I wanted to share a few reasons why I like the particular genres of music I do. There are exceptions and additions to these points, and it's very hard to limit a genre down to a few ideas. Though I don't mention all of them here, there are more genres that I enjoy, and this is by no means a comparison or to downplay another type of music. I like songs from all genres, I promise!</p>
<br>
<h3> Rock and Roll!</h3>
<p>Rock has always been my go to style of music. I've listened to so many types of Rock, and across so many generations, that I can spend a very long time on this one subject. Rock has always been my standard way of expressing myself. With a quick tempo, awesome solos, and a pumping rhythm, there's just so much to love! What's better than getting fired up, and popping in some earbuds to 'stick it to the man?'. It's such a creative and approachable outlet to nearly every emotion possible and it has the added bonus of a major focus on lyrics. I feel there are a wide range of tones and moods. Rock covers the vocal expressions of Pearl Jam, the jiving feel of Weezer, the head banging of Led Zeppelin, to the technique of Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix really displayed the association from Blues to Rock, and pushed the genre forward.</p>
<br>
<h3>Blues</h3>
<p>I used to have a really hard time listening to the Blues. Maybe it was because it was my dad's favorite, and I thought it was for 'old people'. Whatever the reasons, it felt boring and slow, when I wanted excitement and speed. My dad and brother played guitar, and could listen to the emblished notes and sustains - I was a drummer, and I wanted to hit things faster! It took many years before I understood what the Blues were trying to express. Blues is all about soul, expression, and history. It's sadness and mourning, but it's also rememberance and cherishing. The Blues taught me to slow down, and appreciate life around me - to enjoy what I have, while I have it, and when I do get down, how important it is to talk and express yourself through it.</p>
<br>
<h3>Country</h3>
<p>I was also slow to adapt to Country music. Country often had a melancholy feeling, and had a lot of depressing stories that I struggled to look past. I'm very glad that I did, though, as it's become such an important resource for nostalgia of home. My hometown and some of my friends epitomized the country lifestyle, and I was always the techy kid that was always looking for a way out. As I've grown older and more appreciative of a slower lifestyle, Country has really started to appeal to me more and more. With a twinning sound, and a speed to really delve into stories, I've found a lot of favorites that grow more and more interesting as life goes on. Country covers loss and sadness, but also joy, family, pride, and purpose. It's helped to keep me grounded, and always looking fondly to home, while facing the future.</p>
<br>
<h3>Heavy Metal</h3>
<p>Heavy Metal can often have such a negative connotation amongst music enthusiasts. Like Rock and Roll, there are so many types of Metal, and it seems that as time goes on, the music only gets louder, edgier, and more incoherent. Old school Heavy Metal was all about working through anger, expressing some angst, and having a good time, with favorites such as Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden. As Metal has progressed, some types have gone farther down screaming and the rage avenue, but the genre is far wider than that initial appearance. Heavy Metal still delves into the old school style, while embracing the newer themes that arise. Metal can be hard to understand, but it's still a Blues and Rock inspired genre, that focuses on lyrics about self expression. Believe it or not, there are Metal songs on loss, love, and passion, anger, anarchy, and even notable figures like Tolkein. All together, it's such a diverse genre that focuses on letting feelings out...as loudly as possible.</p>
<br>
<h3>Classical</h3>
<p>I LOVE piano. I never thought I would say that as a kid, beating away at a drumset, or as an adult picking away at guitar strings. The diversity of a guitar can't really be equaled by many instruments, but the sounds of a piano are so pleasant and calming. Classical instrumentals have a way of expressing emotions from longing and peace to urgency and contemplation with ease. It takes some time, especially for a 'rocker' to learn to enjoy the soothing music, but is worth the interest!</p>
